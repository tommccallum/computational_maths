# Computational Mathematics

A set of foundational resources based in R for BSc Hons Applied Software Development.  This forms a set of revision notes for students coming from a wide range of educational backgrounds and abilities.

## Useful R notation to know before diving in

* use ```?plot``` to find out help on how to use a command, in this case the plot command
* use ```help(plot)``` to find help on how to use a command, in this case the plot command
* use ```<-``` instead of ```=``` for assignment of values to variables
* use ```all.equal(a,b)``` to compare floating point values not ```==```
* use ```c(1,2,3)``` to define an array of values
* use ```list("key"=1)``` to define a list
* use ```data.frame``` to represent a spreadsheet of data
* use ```read.csv``` to read in a csv of data
* use ```plot``` to plot data
* use ```par``` to find more plotting settings
* watch out for the value ```NA``` which can enter in without warning
* R is able to handle calculations of arrays of values so you can do the follow: 

```
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(3,4,5)
a+b
```
