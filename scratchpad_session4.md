# Trig functions

Remember SOH from SOHCAHTOA

$sin(\theta) = \frac{O}{H}$

$H * sin(\theta) = \frac{O}{H} * H$

$H * sin(\theta) = O$

Remember CAH from SOHCAHTOA

$cos(\theta) = \frac{A}{H}$

$H * cos(\theta) = \frac{A}{H} * H$

$H * cos(\theta) = A$


A point can be defined as $(x,y)$, that is
a point on the x axis and a point on the y axis.
If we draw a line through both we will arrive at
the intersection of (x,y).

Given a line y=0.5 and x=-0.5, then they cross
at (-0.5,0.5).

Given 

$O = H * sin(\theta)$

Given the opposite side of our triangle in the unit circle had length $|y|$ then we can say that $y = H * sin(\theta)$.

Given the adjacent side of our triangle in the unit circle had length $|x|$ then we can say that $x = H * cos(\theta)$.

Remember that H is the hypotenuse, which as this is a unit circle... the radius is the hypotenuse, which is 1.

We know that there are 360 degrees in a circle.

The perimeter of a circle is $2 * \pi * r$.

Let r be the radius.

$360 degrees = 2 * \pi * r$

$360 degrees / (2 * \pi) = r$

$\frac{180}{\pi} = r$

In a circle (due to $2\pi r$), there are $2*\pi$ radians.

Noting that $H$ is just our radius.  And our radius is just 1.

$x = cos(\theta)$

$y = sin(\theta)$

for the unit circle.

For a non-unit circle:

$x = radius*cos(\theta)$

$y = radius*sin(\theta)$

Given a tangent that bisects our radius where the radius meets the unit circle.  

Assume the radius has equation

$y=mx+c$

$y=-\frac{1}{m}x + c$
