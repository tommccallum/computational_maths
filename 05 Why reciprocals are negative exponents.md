# Why reciprocals (fractions) are negative exponents?

The following caught our students interest as to why this should be.

For example:

$\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ 

To understand why this might be we need to go to the definition of a reciprocal.

What we want to find is a number that when multiplied by $\frac{1}{x}$ gives you 1.

$\frac{1}{x} * {x} = {1}$ 

During the following steps, we have to keep the equality true at all times.

We then assume that $x$ takes the form $a^{x}$.  Why do we do this?  It turns out any value can be represented as a exponent, so this does not lose any generality.  $a$ is a real number and $x$ is a real value.

Plugging this in to the above equation gives:

$\frac{1}{a^x} * a^{x} = {1}$

The 1's can be rewritten as $a^0$.

$\frac{a^0}{a^x} * a^{x} = a^0$

Note the rule that we add exponents:

$x^a * x^b = x^{a+b}$

If the equality holds, then $\frac{a^0}{a^x}$ must be equal to $a^{-x}$.

How can this be?

The only way it can hold is that:

$\frac{a^0}{a^x} = a^0 * a^{-x} = a^{-x}$

Plug this into the following $x^a * x^b = x^{a+b}$ gives us:

$a^x * a^{-x} = a^{x+(-x)} = a^0 = 1$

So we have shown that the reciprocal of a number is the same as a negative exponent.
